# School-Management-System

This app is designed using HTML, PHP, Jquery, CSS, MYSQL and is meant to be used by school admin/manager to manage their school records: student data, staff and finances.

It currently doesn't have options for students/staff to login. Solely, it's expected to be used on a single machine or online for managers only. In future we are planning to add the username and login feature for the students and staff panel.
